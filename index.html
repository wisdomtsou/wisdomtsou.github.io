<h2 id="font-colorce4034biographyfont"><font color=#CE4034>Biography</font></h2>
<p>Yongpan Zou (<strong><font face="STXingkai" size=4>邹永攀</font></strong>, [<a href="https://yongpanzou.github.io/data/CV-cn.pdf"><strong>CV-cn</strong></a>]) is currently a tenured Associate Professor in the College of Computer Science and Software Engineering of Shenzhen University, since July 2022. Before that, he has been an Assistant Professor in CSSE of Shenzhen University since September 2017. He obtained his Ph.D degree in February 2017 in the <a href="https://www.cse.ust.hk/">CSE Department</a> of <a href="http://www.ust.hk/">HKUST</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/lionelni">Professor Lionel M. Ni</a>. Prior to this, he received his Bachelor degree in <a href="http://clet.xjtu.edu.cn/index.htm">School of Chemical Engineering and Technology</a>, <a href="http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/">Xi&rsquo;an Jiaotong University</a> in July 2013. From March to August of 2017, I have been working as a research assistant in University of Macau.</p>
<p>In the past few years, he has been recognized as Overseas High-Caliber Personnel (深圳市海外高层次人才) and High-level Talent in Nanshan District of Shenzhen (深圳市南山区领航人才). He has also achieved several academic awards owing to his excellent work in the field of ubiquitous and mobile computing, including the First Prize of Shenzhen Natual Science Award (深圳市自然科学奖一等奖), China Patent Awards of Excellence (中国专利优秀奖), Guangdong Patent Awards of Excellence (广东省专利优秀奖), the First Prize of GDCA Outstanding Research Papers (广东省计算机学会优秀论文一等奖), the Best Paper Award of IEEE MASS (最佳论文奖), and etc..  He has published more than 20 research papers in highly recognized conferences and journals such as ACM Ubicomp, ACM Mobicom, IEEE ICDCS, IEEE PerCom, and IEEE TMC, and received several research funds such as General Program of National NSF (基金委面上项目) and Yonth Program of National NSF (基金委青年项目).</p>
<!-- His research filed is ubiquitous and mobile computing. Within this area, he has published more than 20 research papers in highly recognized conferences and journals such as ACM Ubicomp, ACM Mobicom, IEEE ICDCS, IEEE PerCom, and IEEE TMC. He has received several research funds such as General Program of National NSF (基金委面上项目) and Yonth Program of National NSF (基金委青年项目). He has been granted 4 U.S. patents and 30 Chinese patents for invention. His research work has also attracted attention from industry such as Tencent and Huawei, which leads to cooperation projects with these companies to turn cool technology into commercial products.  He is serving the community actively by joining in profession committees, participating in the organizing and reviewing activities of international conferences and journals. He has served as a member of IEEE, ACM, and CCF, technical program chairs of ACM CPD 2022 and PCC 2019, publication chairs of ICPADS 2017\~2019, local chair of EAI ICECI 2021, and TPC members of IEEE UIC, IEEE MSN, IEEE HPCC, and etc.. In addition to research, YONGPAN has also paid much attention to teaching and supervision work, and achieved many awards such as Second Prize in the 10th Lecture Competition for Young Teachers of Shenzhen University (深圳大学青年教师讲课竞赛二等奖), Outstanding Undergraduate Teacher Award (优秀本科教师奖), and etc.. -->

<h2 id="font-colorce4034interestfont"><font color=#CE4034>Interest</font></h2>
<p>My research interest covers Wearable and Mobile Computing, Human-computer Interaction, and Ubiquitous Sensing. My vision is to develop new technologies, algorithms, and systems that enable smart sensing, provide intelligent services, and deliver novel applications. I draw on novel sensing &amp; computing technologies with <em>embedded system design</em>, <em>machine learning models</em>, <em>signal processing algorithms</em>, and <em>mathematical methods</em> to solve real-world problems. I am now leading <em>Intelligent Perception and Mobile Computing</em> Group.</p>
